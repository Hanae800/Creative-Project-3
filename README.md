## Summary of my Creative Project 3

In Creative Project Number 3, I decided to work with **p5.js** and in particular **Sound library** I made a snake game based on a tutorial and added background music to it, sound effects each time the snake eats and every time it bumps into the corners, and another sound to signal that the game is over. Also, I generated a different background color each time one time the user hits one of the directions keys. I combined sound, music, and random interactive colors to create an Audiovisual environment. 

I build off of the tutorial Coding Challenge #3: The Snake Game available in YouTube Chanel **The Coding Train**  available at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM&t=1s&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain
_The Idea was to make something fun and, that requires people's undivided attention by adding sound and colors to it._ 

I used the **keyPressed function** as a control mechanism for the snake and the random color generation so the user can use the UP/DOWN/RIGHT/LEFT keys to move the snake and change the colors, which is basically what is the same mechanism that the original game uses.

**Instructions to run the project ** 

1. Open the p5.js browser editor
2. Upload the sketch.js file available in this repository of this project
3. Include the sound library in the index file (access tab in the dropdown menu to the left) 
4. Save the file
5. Run the sketch
6. Enjoy the Snake game!
7. Also you can just use the full-screen version available at the following link: https://editor.p5js.org/Hanae800/full/UGiMJhG2B

## Artist Statement

The Snake Game was an attempt to make a game that I grew up playing. I wanted to add background music, sounds effects, and colors to it to create an engaging user experience. I think random colors in particular provide visuals to capture the attention of the user. I also wanted to use music in the background to create an amplified sound experience.
