## Summary of my Creative Project 3

In Creative Project Number 3, I decided to work with **p5.js** and in particular **Sound library** I made a snake game based on a tutorial and added music to it to create an Audio visual enviroenemnt. 

I build off of the tutorial Coding Challenge #3: The Snake Game available in YouTube Chanel **The Coding Train** : _The Idea was to make something fun and, tha requires people's undevided attention and add a sound to it to make it more enjoyable._ 

I used the **keyPressed function** as a control mechanism for the snake so the user can use the UP/DOWN/RIGHT/LEFT keys in order to move the snake, which is basically what is the same mechanism that the original game uses.



**Instructions to run the project ** 

1. Open the p5.js browser editor
2. Upload the sketch.js file available in this repository of this project
3. Access the library here **https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery/blob/master/index.html** or download it from this repository file name **tracery.js**
4. Include the sound library in the index file (access tab in the dropdown menu to the left) 
5. Save the file
6. Run the sketch
7. Enjoy the Snake game!
8. Also you can just use the full-screen version available at the following link: https://editor.p5js.org/Hanae800/full/kTr_23M0e

## Artist Statement

The Snake Game was an attemp to make a very small large game that I grew up playing. I wanted to add background music to it to create more of an engaging experience.
